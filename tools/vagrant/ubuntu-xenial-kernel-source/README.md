# Linux kernel module source for USB serial hardware

Unlike normal Ubuntu, the Ubuntu image for Vagrant does not support USB serial
port. This source tree is to enable USB serial support for it.

See [`../install_usb_serial_modules.sh`](../install_usb_serial_modules.sh)
to compile and install them. Also [`README in the parent directory`](../) shows
how to update it to a newer source.
